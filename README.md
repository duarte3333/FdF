# Creating a FEM software with Matlab

## Explanation
Wireframe models are an essential tool in the world 
of graphics programming, as they allow designers and 
developers to visualize and understand the structure 
and layout of 3D objects without the need for surface 
details or textures. In this project, my main goal was
to create a simple wireframe model representation of 
a 3D landscape by linking various points (x, y, z) 
using line segments (edges).

To create the wireframe model, I used a combination 
of graphics programming techniques and spatial geometry 
principles. By linking points in 3D space using line segments,
I was able to represent the basic structure and layout of the 
landscape. This process allows to visualize and understand 
the overall shape and form of the landscape, as well as identify 
any potential issues or areas for improvement.

One of the key advantages of using a wireframe model in this 
context is the ability to quickly and easily manipulate and 
modify the model as needed. By adjusting the position of points 
and line segments, we were able to refine the overall structure 
and layout of the landscape to better match our desired design.

## Views
The possible views of the program, in the upper left corner we have the front view, below we have the top view. In the lower left corner is the projection of the right view and below it is the isometric projection.

In addition, a parallel view has been added to the program:

## Applications

1. Computer-aided design (CAD): Wireframe models are often used in CAD 
software to represent the basic structure and layout of objects and systems. 
They can be used to design everything from buildings and 
infrastructure to automobiles and aircraft.

2. Computer graphics: Wireframe models are commonly used in computer 
graphics to represent 3D objects in games and other interactive media. 
They are often used as a starting point for more complex models with 
surface details and textures.

3. Architecture: Architects and urban planners often use wireframe models to 
visualize and understand the structure and layout of buildings and cities.

4. Industrial design: Industrial designers use  wireframe models to represent 
the basic structure and layout of products such as furniture, appliances, and consumer electronics.

5. Film and animation: Wireframe models are used in the film and animation 
industry to represent 3D objects and environments in pre-visualization and 
planning stages.

6. Virtual reality: Wireframe models are often used to create immersive 
virtual reality experiences, as they provide a basic structure and layout 
for the virtual environment without the need for high levels of detail.
